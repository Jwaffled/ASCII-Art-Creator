# ASCII Art Creator

This WPF application converts a user-specified image (.png, .jpeg, or .jpg) and converts it into ASCII art!

The slider controls the amount of detail in the image. 
For the best view of a detailed image, save the file as a .txt and zoom out on notepad or another text editor of your choice.
